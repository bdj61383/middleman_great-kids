  content: "<p>''Ten steps from the porch and twenty steps from the rose bushes,'' growled Bluebeard in Jimmy's dream one night. ''There be treasure there! Aawrgh.''</p><p>So the next day Jimmy began to dig. He dug until the hole was deep and the dirt pile was high.</p><p>He kept digging. The hole got deeper and the dirt pile got higher.</p><p>He dug until the hole was deepest and the dirt pile was at its highest. He sighed. ''I'm too tired. I can't dig anymore.'' Then he spied something...</p><p>...but it was only one of Woofy's bones. Instead of treasure, all Jimmy had was a dog bone, a hole, and a big pile of dirt to fill it in with. He thought ''That pirate lied to me!''</p><p>But when Jimmy's mother saw what he had done, she clasped her hands and smiled a smile from here to Sunday. ''Oh, thank you, Jimmy. I always wanted a rhododendron bush planted just there. Here's $5.00 for digging that hole.''</p>"
